\title{Create a test plan for mutation testing}
\usage{
test_plan(mutators, source_files = fs::dir_ls("R", regexp = ".[rR]$"))
}
\arguments{
\item{mutators}{A list of mutators to use. See \code{\link[=operator]{operator()}}.}

\item{source_files}{A vector of file paths to the source files.}
}
\value{
A data frame with the test plan.
}
\description{
The purpose of this function is to create and preview a plan for mutation testing.
}
\details{
Each mutant requires rerunning the tests. For large project it might be not feasible to test all
mutants in one go. This function allows you to create a plan for selected source files and mutators.

The plan is in a data frame format, where each row represents a mutant.

You can subset the plan before passing it to the \code{test()} function.
