To get the mutation score, we need to do the following steps:

# Generate mutants

Project files are read and stored as character vectors by `test_plan`.
`mutators` provided to `test_plan` are applied to the original code to generate mutants.

If we have only one mutator `+` â†’ `-` and code `a + b + c`, the generated mutants will be `a - b + c` and `a + b - c`.
Even if we have only one mutator and one line of code, many mutants can be generated.

Only one change like this is applied to the code at a time, one file at a time.

# Copy the project and apply the mutation

We copy the project to a temporary directory using `?CopyStrategy`.

For each generated mutation, we create a fresh copy of the project, one copy is created at a time.

We overwrite the mutated file in project copy.


> ðŸ’¡ This is needed since R is not a compiled language and code can be sourced during runtime.
>
> If the mutated code was evaluated from the lines we read and mutated in [step 1](#generate-mutants) (from memory), then we could miss some mutations, as some test files could source the original code.
>
> Even if we mutated the code from `R/calculate.R`, when running the test the original code would be sourced and the test would pass.
>
> ```r
> #' testst/testthat/test_calculate.R
> source("R/calculate.R")
> test_that("calculate", {
>   expect_equal(calculate(1, 2), 3)
> })
> ```
>
> It's even more apparent for projects that use modules like `box`, they always source the tested code on the fly.
>
> ```r
> #' testst/testthat/test_calculate.R
> box::use(R/calculate)
> test_that("calculate", {
>  expect_equal(calculate$calculate(1, 2), 3)
> })
> ```

# Run tests and calculate the mutation score

We run the tests on the copied project with the mutated code.

The results are counted, only test failures and total number of test runs contribute to the mutation score.

Some mutants will inevitably lead to runtime errors, those are not counted as failures and are not included in the mutation score.

The mutation score is the percentage of mutants that were detected by the tests.

# Clean up

We clean up the temporary directory to remove any files that were created during the mutation testing process.
